## Projects: Term 2  
### Natural Language Processing

1. Character-wise Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)  
Build a character-wise RNN trained on Anna Karenina to generate new text based on the text from the book.  

2. Sentiment Prediction RNN  
Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if a text sample is positive or negative.  

3. Bookworm  
Build a simple question-answering system using IBM Watson's NLP services.  

4. Capstone Project: Machine Translation  
Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.  

### Computer Vision
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Tutorials  

2. Dog Breed Classifier  
Build a deep neural network that can identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed from a given image of a dog.  

3. Mimic Me!  
Use [Affectiva's](http://www.affectiva.com/) Emotion-as-a-Service API to track faces in a video and identify facial expressions.  

4. Capstone Project: Facial Keypoint Detection  
Build a deep neural network that can take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints.  

### Autoencoders  
1. Simple autoencoder  

2. Convolutional Autoencoder  

### Generative Adversatial Network (GAN)
1. GAN on MNIST  
Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.  

2. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)  
Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.  

3. Semi-supervised GAN  
Train a semi-supervised GAN.
