## Projects: Term 2  
### Natural Language Processing
1. [Embedding and Word2Vec](./embeddings/Skip-Gram_word2vec.ipynb)  
Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.

2. [Sequence to sequence](./seq2seq/seq2seq.ipynb)  
 Implement a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network.

3. [Character-wise Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)](./intro-to-rnns)  
Build a character-wise RNN trained on Anna Karenina to generate new text based on the text from the book.  

4. [Sentiment Prediction RNN](./sentiment-rnn)  
Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if a text sample is positive or negative.  

5. [Bookworm](./AIND-NLP-Bookworm)  
Build a simple question-answering system using IBM Watson's NLP services.  

6. [Capstone Project: Machine Translation](./aind2-nlp-capstone)  
Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.  

### Computer Vision
1. [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Exercises](./aind2-cnn)  

2. [Dog Breed Classifier](./dog-project)  
Build a deep neural network that can identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed from a given image of a dog.  

3. [Mimic Me!](./AIND-CV-Mimic)  
Use [Affectiva's](http://www.affectiva.com/) Emotion-as-a-Service API to track faces in a video and identify facial expressions.  

4. [Capstone Project: Facial Keypoint Detection](./AIND-CV-FacialKeypoints)  
Build a deep neural network that can take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints.  

### Generative Adversatial Network (GAN)
1. [GAN on MNIST](./gan_mnist/Intro_to_GANs.ipynb)  
Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.  

2. [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](./dcgan-svhn/DCGAN.ipynb)  
Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the [Street View House Numbers](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) (SVHN) dataset.  

3. [Semi-supervised GAN](./semi-supervised/semi-supervised_learning_2.ipynb)  
Train a semi-supervised GAN to classify the images with a large proportion of the labels dropped.

### Autoencoders  
1. [Simple autoencoder](./autoencoder/Simple_Autoencoder.ipynb)  
Build a simple autoencoder using TensorFlow.

2. [Convolutional Autoencoder](./autoencoder/Convolutional_Autoencoder.ipynb)  
Build models for image compression and denoising, using feed-forward and convolution networks in TensorFlow.
